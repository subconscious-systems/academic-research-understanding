## Guidelines
- Always use typescript
- Always use react-hook-form when building form components
- Always use yup for validation (and use yup with react-hook-form)
- Use shadcn components stored in components/ and components/ui when possible

## CLI Guidelines
- we use pnpm in this codebase
- use pnpx inplace of npx to run scripts
- use pnpm add <package> to install packages
- use pnpm remove <package> to remove packages

## Convex Rules
- We use convex as our database with two way sync between client and server
- generate mutations, queries, and actions with convex in the /convex folder
- Use useQuery() for reading data and useMutation() for writing data - these hooks automatically handle loading states and real-time updates

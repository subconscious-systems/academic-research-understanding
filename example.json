However, since the survey is comprehensive and covers post-training and optimization techniques, it is likely to discuss these common RL algorithmic choices in the context of LLM alignment and training.\n\n**How to Use This Information for Further Searches:**\n\n- To find details on PPO variants, normalization, clipping, and aggregation strategies specifically:\n  - Access the full PDF ([link here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/5128927.pdf?abstractid=5128927&mirid=1)).\n  - Search within the document for terms like \"PPO\", \"normalization\", \"clipping\", \"aggregation\", and \"reward model\".\n- Follow up with searches for:\n  - \"RLHF PPO variants large language models\"\n  - \"reward normalization and clipping in LLM RL\"\n  - \"aggregation strategies in RL for language models\"\n- Look for recent reviews or surveys on RL in LLMs, as this paper highlights ongoing research directions and challenges, which can lead to more granular discussions in related works.\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe survey comprehensively covers RL applications in LLMs, focusing on their role in data generation, pretraining, post-training, and inference. While the abstract does not detail PPO variants or specific RL algorithmic strategies, the full paper likely addresses these in the context of alignment and optimization. For in-depth technical details, consult the full text and use targeted keyword searches as suggested.",

This surge is driven by RL's demonstrated potential to enhance LLMs' advanced reasoning capabilities in challenging tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, this rapid proliferation has led to significant fragmentation within the community.\n\nThe authors identify critical problems stemming from this uncoordinated growth: a lack of standardized guidelines for employing various RL techniques, fragmented understanding of underlying mechanisms, and inconsistent experimental settings across studies. These issues create \"confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques\" and lead to contradictory conclusions in different studies.\n\nThis paper directly addresses these challenges by positioning itself as a systematic effort to bring order and clarity to the RL4LLM landscape. Rather than proposing new algorithms, the authors undertake a rigorous empirical study of widely adopted RL techniques within a unified framework.\n\nMethodology and Experimental Design\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe research employs a systematic empirical methodology using **ROLL (Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Large-scale Learning)**, an open-source platform designed specifically for RL optimization in LLMs. All experiments use **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** as the base algorithm with advantage values estimated using the **REINFORCE algorithm** in a \"critic-free\" setting.\n\nThe experimental design includes consistent parameters across all studies: rollout batch sizes of 128 prompts with 8 responses each, maximum response lengths of 8192 tokens, and learning rates of 1e-6. The authors evaluate performance across multiple model sizes (Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B, both base and aligned versions) and carefully curated datasets with controlled difficulty levels.\n\nTraining datasets include three difficulty tiers: Easy Data (5,000 entries from SimpleRL-Zoo-Data-Easy), Medium Data (5,000 easiest examples from DeepMath-103k), and Hard Data (5,000 proportionally sampled entries from DeepMath-103k). Evaluation occurs on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks: MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MinervaMath, and subsets of standardized examinations (AIME24-25, AMC23).\n\nKey Findings on Normalization Strategies\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe analysis reveals that normalization strategies significantly impact RL training stability and effectiveness. Group-level normalization demonstrates consistent robustness across various reward settings, while batch-level normalization shows high sensitivity to reward scale. The research shows that batch-level normalization improves under large-scale reward settings (`R \u2208 {-1, 1}`) but can collapse with imbalanced batches and skewed reward distributions (`R \u2208 {0, 1}`).\n\nA critical finding involves the standard deviation term in advantage normalization. Removing this term (using only mean subtraction) enhances stability, particularly when reward distributions are highly concentrated on easy datasets. This prevents extreme gradient amplification caused by tiny standard deviations. The authors propose a robust normalization technique combining group-level mean calculation with batch-level standard deviation, leveraging stable guidance and strong regularization.\n\nClipping Strategy Analysis\n--------------------------\n\nThe investigation of Clipping strategies reveals model-dependent effectiveness patterns. Increasing the `Clip-Higher` parameter (relaxing upper bounds on ratio clipping) benefits models with stronger fundamental reasoning abilities, particularly aligned/instruct models. Base models with limited exploratory capacity show minimal improvement or potential harm from increased clipping bounds.\n\nThe research demonstrates that traditional clipping (`\u03b5_high=0.2`) disproportionately suppresses discourse connectives like \"therefore,\" \"if,\" and \"but,\" potentially restricting innovative reasoning structures. Increasing `\u03b5_high` to 0.28 shifts clipping focus to high-frequency functional tokens while allowing broader exploration of reasoning structures.\n\nInterestingly, the authors identify a \"scaling law\" for small models (4B parameters), where performance gradually improves with increasing `\u03b5_high` up to 0.32. However, this trend doesn't hold for larger models (8B), where `\u03b5_high=0.28` proves more optimal, suggesting model-specific hyperparameter requirements.\n\nLoss Aggregation and Filtering Techniques\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe comparison between token-level and sequence-level loss aggregation reveals clear model-dependent preferences. Token-level aggregation proves more effective for base models by ensuring equal token contribution and improving convergence, peak accuracy, and robustness. Conversely, aligned/instruct models often perform better with sequence-level aggregation, as these models already possess stable reasoning capabilities.\n\nOverlong filtering analysis shows task-dependent effectiveness patterns. The technique proves highly beneficial for short-to-medium length reasoning tasks, enhancing accuracy and clarity. However, its effectiveness diminishes for long-tail reasoning tasks, especially with very high maximum generation lengths (20k tokens). The mechanism primarily helps models distinguish between \"completed\" and \"truncated\" generations by pruning unproductive or repetitive outputs.\n\nLite PPO: The Power of Simplicity\n---------------------------------\n\nBased on isolated analyses, the authors propose **Lite PPO**, a minimalist combination of two techniques: advantage normalization using group-level mean with batch-level standard deviation, and token-level loss aggregation. This simple approach consistently outperforms more complex algorithms like GRPO and DAPO across various experimental conditions.\n\nLite PPO demonstrates particular superiority on small non-aligned models lacking basic reasoning abilities and larger base models tackling hard datasets. This finding challenges the common assumption that more techniques necessarily lead to better performance, suggesting that well-chosen minimalist approaches can be more effective and stable than complex, technique-heavy algorithms.\n\nSignificance and Impact\n-----------------------\n\nThis research makes several significant contributions to the RL4LLM field. By systematically reproducing and isolating the effects of widely used RL techniques, the paper resolves significant ambiguities and conflicting conclusions that have plagued the field. The work provides concrete, actionable guidelines for technique selection tailored to specific experimental setups, including model type, data difficulty, and reward mechanisms.\n\nThe success of Lite PPO represents a paradigm shift, demonstrating that careful selection and understanding of core mechanisms can yield superior results compared to stacking multiple \"tricks.\" This finding encourages more principled and parsimonious algorithmic design in RL4LLM applications.\n\nThe commitment to reproducibility through the unified ROLL framework and explicit calls for increased implementation detail disclosure sets high standards for the field. The paper serves as both an immediate practical resource and a foundation for future research directions, promoting more rigorous, transparent, and efficient approaches to RL4LLM development.\n\nRelevant Citations\n------------------\n\nZhihong Shao, Peiyi Wang, Qihao Zhu, Runxin Xu, Junxiao Song, Xiao Bi, Haowei Zhang, Mingchuan Zhang, Y.

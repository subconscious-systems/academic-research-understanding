These models frequently produce hallucinations, generate harmful content, and struggle with complex instruction following. To address these limitations, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial framework for aligning LLMs with human values and enhancing their reasoning capabilities.\\n\\nThis technical survey by Srivastava and Aggarwal provides a comprehensive examination of how RL techniques are transforming LLM development. The work systematically analyzes various RL approaches, from the widely-adopted Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to recent innovations like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike traditional supervised learning methods that rely on fixed datasets, RL enables LLMs to learn from feedback and optimize for complex, non-differentiable objectives such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty.\\n\\nFoundational Concepts and Motivation\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nThe core motivation for applying RL to LLMs stems from the inherent limitations of supervised learning approaches. Traditional pre-training and fine-tuning methods, while effective for pattern recognition, are insufficient for addressing nuanced aspects of desired behavior such as:\\n\\n*   **Alignment with human preferences**: Ensuring outputs reflect human values and intentions\\n*   **Safety and ethical constraints**: Preventing generation of harmful, biased, or toxic content\\n*   **Complex reasoning**: Enabling multi-step logical inference and problem-solving\\n*   **Instruction following**: Accurately interpreting and executing complex user requests\\n\\nThe survey establishes that RL is uniquely suited to address these challenges because it can incorporate subjective feedback, optimize for sequential decision-making, and handle non-differentiable reward signals. The authors frame the LLM generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the model's policy generates text sequences while receiving feedback through reward signals.\\n\\nKey Reinforcement Learning Techniques\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\n### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\\n\\nPPO has become the cornerstone of LLM alignment, particularly in RLHF pipelines. The algorithm optimizes the policy using a clipped surrogate objective that prevents destructive policy updates:\\n\\nL C L I P(\\u03b8)=E t[min\\u2061(r t(\\u03b8)A^t,clip(r t(\\u03b8),1\\u2212\\u03f5,1+\\u03f5)A^t)]L^{CLIP}(\\\\theta) = \\\\mathbb{E}_t\\\\left[\\\\min\\\\left(r_t(\\\\theta)\\\\hat{A}_t, \\\\text{clip}(r_t(\\\\theta), 1-\\\\epsilon, 1+\\\\epsilon)\\\\hat{A}_t\\\\right)\\\\right]\\n\\nwhere r t(\\u03b8)=\\u03c0 \\u03b8(a t\\u2223s t)\\u03c0 \\u03b8 o l d(a t\\u2223s t)r_t(\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi_\\\\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\\\\pi_{\\\\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)} is the probability ratio and A^t\\\\hat{A}_t is the advantage estimate.\\n\\n### Off-Policy Methods\\n\\nThe survey details several off-policy approaches that offer improved sample efficiency:\\n\\n**Implicit Language Q-Learning (ILQL)** combines the stability of value-based methods with the expressiveness of policy optimization. The loss function incorporates both value learning and policy extraction:\\n\\nL I L Q L=L V+L Q+L \\u03c0 L_{ILQL} = L_{V} + L_{Q} + L_{\\\\pi}\\n\\n**Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** addresses the computational challenges of PPO by using a group-based approach that reduces memory requirements while maintaining performance, as demonstrated in models like DeepSeek-R1.\\n\\n### Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\\n\\nDPO represents a significant paradigm shift by eliminating the explicit reward model entirely. Instead of the traditional three-stage RLHF pipeline, DPO directly optimizes the policy using preference pairs:\\n\\nL D P O(\\u03c0 \\u03b8)=\\u2212E(x,y w,y l)\\u223cD[log\\u2061\\u03c3(\\u03b2 log\\u2061\\u03c0 \\u03b8(y w\\u2223x)\\u03c0 r e f(y w\\u2223x)\\u2212\\u03b2 log\\u2061\\u03c0 \\u03b8(y l\\u2223x)\\u03c0 r e f(y l\\u2223x))]L_{DPO}(\\\\pi_\\\\theta) = -\\\\mathbb{E}_{(x,y_w,y_l) \\\\sim D}\\\\left[\\\\log\\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\beta \\\\log\\\\frac{\\\\pi_\\\\theta(y_w|x)}{\\\\pi_{ref}(y_w|x)} - \\\\beta \\\\log\\\\frac{\\\\pi_\\\\theta(y_l|x)}{\\\\pi_{ref}(y_l|x)}\\\\right)\\\\right]\\n\\nThis approach offers improved computational efficiency and training stability while often matching or exceeding PPO-based RLHF performance.\\n\\nApplications and Performance Analysis\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\n### Alignment with Human Preferences\\n\\nThe survey provides extensive quantitative analysis of different alignment techniques. Unified Alignment (UNA), particularly its score-based variant with MSE loss, demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks. UNA-score achieves the highest average scores on both new (30.92) and old (64.35) Open LLM Leaderboards, with notable improvements in instruction following (IFEval: 37.25 vs. 23.22 for baseline, a 60.4% improvement) and factual accuracy (TruthfulQA: 55.09 vs. 42.58 for baseline, a 29.4% improvement).\\n\\n### Reasoning Enhancement\\n\\nRL techniques have proven crucial for developing sophisticated reasoning capabilities:\\n\\n*   **Outcome-Based RL (OB-RL)** trains models using sparse rewards based on final answer correctness\\n*   **Chain-of-Thought Reward Optimization (CoT-RO)** provides dense rewards for intermediate reasoning steps\\n*   **Verifier-Guided RL (RLVR)** uses external verifiers to provide reward signals, boosting GPT-3.5's accuracy on GSM8K from 56.8% to 72.5%\\n\\n### Code Generation and Tool Use\\n\\nRL-based fine-tuning significantly enhances code generation capabilities. OpenAI's Codex more than doubled its HumanEval accuracy through RLHF based on unit test pass rates. Modern models like Llama 3.3 70B Versatile, using PPO+DPO hybrid approaches, achieve top-tier coding performance (88.4% on HumanEval, 87.6% on MBPP).\\n\\nFor tool-augmented reasoning, hierarchical RL enables LLMs to decide when and how to interact with external tools, optimizing for both efficiency and factual grounding.\\n\\nChallenges and Future Directions\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nDespite significant progress, the survey identifies several persistent challenges:\\n\\n**Reward Hacking**: Models may exploit loopholes in reward functions rather than genuinely improving behavior, leading to misaligned optimization.\\n\\n**Computational Costs**: RL training, particularly with on-policy methods like PPO, remains computationally expensive for large models, limiting accessibility.\\n\\n**Sample Efficiency**: RL algorithms often require vast amounts of interaction data, making them resource-intensive.\\n\\n**Evaluation Limitations**: Existing benchmarks may not fully capture all failure modes or detect \\\"alignment faking\\\" behaviors.\\n\\nThe authors highlight promising future directions including hybrid RL algorithms that combine the strengths of different approaches, multi-objective alignment frameworks that balance competing objectives, and the integration of causal inference techniques for more robust reward modeling.\\n\\nComparative Analysis and Taxonomy\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nA key contribution of this survey is its systematic comparative analysis of 13 prominent RL techniques across 12 dimensions, including reward model strategy, feedback mechanism, RL paradigm, and optimization approach. This taxonomy provides researchers with a clear framework for understanding the landscape of available methods and their relative strengths.\\n\\nThe performance comparisons across various benchmarks reveal that no single technique dominates all tasks, emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate methods based on specific application requirements and constraints.\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nThis comprehensive survey demonstrates that reinforcement learning has become indispensable for developing capable, safe, and aligned large language models. By systematically analyzing the current state of the art and identifying future research directions, the work provides a crucial roadmap for the continued advancement of RL techniques in LLM development. The transition from simple text generation to sophisticated reasoning agents capable of following complex instructions, generating safe content, and performing multi-step problem-solving represents a fundamental shift in how we approach AI system development, with RL serving as the key enabling technology.\\n\\nRelevant Citations\\n------------------\\n\\n[Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback](https://alphaxiv.org/abs/2203.02155)\\nThis paper introduced Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) via the InstructGPT model, establishing the foundational three-stage process for aligning LLMs with human preferences.
